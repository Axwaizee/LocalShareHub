3. Extract the downloaded zip file to any directory you prefer.
4. Open Terminal / Command Prompt at that Directory.
5. Run `npm install` in the terminal.

## Adding Port Configuration

After you have set all the required files and folders, add `.env` file to the root (LocalShareHub) directory. In the file give port no. as shown in `.env.sample` file. Make sure the port you mention is not used by any other application on the computer.

```ini
